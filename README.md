# CEN3031-Project
Sup how are you doing today, WAZZZUP
## For the build process, I know that everyone wants to use an IDE, but just in case I added two files here, a build.bat, and a build.sh. If you are using windows, you can run the build.bat with .\build.bat 
## and it will execute the commands to build the project. For macos and linux users, do chmod +x build.sh and once you have done that, then run ./build.sh and it will build the executable for you
